    "\n",
    "Before we begin to explore Numpy and all of its applications, we need to remember why data science is so important today and why data scientists choose Python. Data science can be thought of as the basis for **empirical research**, since data is used to inform our **hypotheses** and provide **observations**. In many cases, this data is used either by businesses or by scientists to inform their understanding of a phenomenon. We use a combination of exploratory data analysis and modeling to draw conclusions from larges troves of data. Data science allows us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **analyze the past**, and\n",
    "* **predict the future** through large scale data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our more recent ability to collect data in real time from many places in cluding websites, smart phones, and environmental sensors makes data science indredibly relevent in almost every industry, scientific discipline, or engineering endeavor today.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why is Python a good programming language for data science? Well, it is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* an easy-to-learn and readable language\n",
    "* an open language with a vibrant community\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to the efforts of this community, it offers an ever-growing set of data management, analytical processing, and visualization libraries, like Numpy, Pandas, and Sci-Kit Learn! Such libraries make Python applicable to every aspect of data science.\n",
    "Lastly, but very importantly, **Jupyter Notebooks** make Python-based analysis more producible and repeatable. They also provide built-in training and communication support to help with team collaboration."
